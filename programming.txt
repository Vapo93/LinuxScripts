Describe optimal use for Bash scripts
Make simple scripts that use shell's abilities and automate a lot of tasks that would otherwise require a lot of commands. For example you can make a script that will automatically make git pushes and commits for you (you dont have to write so many commands anymore if you make a script that does it for you). 

Describe optimal use for Python scripts
Making protypes for you applications and programs. So you can test programs.

Describe optimal use for C programming language
If you are doing an IoT application or devoloping and building databases.

Why makefiles are needed?
A makefile is useful because (if properly defined) allows recompiling only what is needed when you make a change.
